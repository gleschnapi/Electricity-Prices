# TODO: Not sure if it's a good way to define locales consistently here, but feels like it. 
# - It's very confusing when mixing languages and locales.
# - If only specifying the language, `Locale.current.region` returns nil in the UI test.
# - Currently this does not generate the correct folder structure (as expected by deliver).
