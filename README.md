Electricity Prices is an open source app that allows you to see the current electricity price on your Apple Watch, iPhone and iPad.<br>
I created this app mainly for the Apple Watch, as I wanted such an app for myself and couldn't find one at the time. I added iPhone/iPad support because it was easy and I wanted try out the new iOS 16 lock screen widgets.

## Download

Electricity Prices is available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/elpriset-widget/id1644399828?platform=appleWatch).

## Resources

-   I found [this reddit answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/r50v12/comment/ik9kif9/) very helpful when I got started. I still don't understand the entsoe documentation on how to construct the `in_Domain`/`out_Domain` values of the query (If there's a better way than manually copying the codes!?) :)
